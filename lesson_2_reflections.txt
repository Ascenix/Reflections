What happens when you initilize a repository ? Why do you need to do it ?

Commit log created.  Tracing information is added to the filing system to track versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository ? What value do you think it offers ?

It's a temporary viewing space. Not for permanent long-term storage.  It creates a workspace to organize the commits.
