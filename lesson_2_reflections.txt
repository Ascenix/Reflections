What happens when you initilize a repository ? Why do you need to do it ?

Commit log created.  Tracing information is added to the filing system to track versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository ? What value do you think it offers ?

It's a temporary viewing space. Not for permanent long-term storage.  It creates a workspace to organize the commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change ?

You may keep the commit in the staging area until the next logical change. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized ? How would branches help ?

Working on multiple versions of a program or a device that may or may not be combined in the future. It's easy to switch between the modes and keep track of the changes within each branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure ?

Easy to see the un-reachable commits.
